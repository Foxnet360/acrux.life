# Database Schema Documentation

## Indexes and Performance Considerations

### Recommended Indexes

1. **users table**
   - `email` (unique) - for login lookups
   - `role` - for role-based queries
   - `isActive` - for active user queries

2. **objectives table**
   - `userId` - for creator lookups
   - `status` - for status filtering
   - `createdAt` - for sorting

3. **pulse_checks table**
   - `objectiveId` - for objective pulse history
   - `userId` - for user pulse history
   - `createdAt` - for chronological ordering

4. **blockers table**
   - `objectiveId` - for objective blockers
   - `status` - for open blocker queries
   - `severity` - for priority queries

5. **objective_assignments table**
   - Composite index on `[userId, objectiveId]` (already enforced by unique constraint)
   - `isActive` - for active assignment queries

6. **pulse_requests table**
   - `memberId, status` - for pending request queries
   - `adminId` - for admin-sent requests
   - `objectiveId` - for objective-related requests

---

## Data Integrity Rules

### Cascade Delete Behaviors

1. **User deletion**: Cascades to all related records
   - Accounts, Sessions, Objectives, PulseChecks, TeamMembers, ObjectiveAssignments

2. **Objective deletion**: Cascades to
   - Metrics, PulseChecks, Blockers, ObjectiveAssignments
   - PulseRequests: Sets objectiveId to NULL (SetNull)

3. **TeamInvitation acceptance**: Sets NULL on delete of accepted user

### Data Validation

1. **Sentiment and Confidence**: Must be 1-5 scale
2. **Progress and HealthScore**: Must be 0-100 percentage
3. **Status fields**: Must match predefined enum values
4. **Email addresses**: Must be unique across users
5. **Invitation tokens**: Must be unique

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
2. **Session Management**: Handled by NextAuth.js with secure tokens
3. **Anonymous Submissions**: PulseChecks and Blockers support anonymous flag
4. **Role-Based Access**: User roles control access to admin features
5. **Invitation Security**: Time-limited tokens with expiration
6. **Soft Deletes**: isActive flags allow soft deletion of relationships

---

## Query Patterns

### Common Queries

1. **Get user's objectives**
```sql
SELECT * FROM objectives 
WHERE userId = ? OR id IN (
  SELECT objectiveId FROM objective_assignments 
  WHERE userId = ? AND isActive = true
);
```

2. **Get pending pulse requests**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pulse_requests 
WHERE memberId = ? AND status = 'pending' 
ORDER BY dueDate ASC;
```

3. **Get objective health data**
```sql
SELECT o.*, 
  AVG(pc.sentiment) as avg_sentiment,
  AVG(pc.confidence) as avg_confidence,
  COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) as open_blockers
FROM objectives o
LEFT JOIN pulse_checks pc ON pc.objectiveId = o.id
LEFT JOIN blockers b ON b.objectiveId = o.id AND b.status = 'open'
WHERE o.id = ?
GROUP BY o.id;
```

## Migration Strategy

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed database
npx prisma db seed
```

### Schema Updates
```bash
# Create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name description_of_change

# Apply to production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## Backup and Maintenance

1. **Regular Backups**: Automated daily PostgreSQL backups
2. **Data Retention**: Historical pulse checks and blockers retained indefinitely
3. **Cleanup Tasks**:
   - Expired invitations (> 7 days)
   - Expired pulse requests (> 30 days after due date)
   - Inactive sessions (handled by NextAuth.js)
