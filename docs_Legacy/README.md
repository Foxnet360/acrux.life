## üîë Key Concepts

### Objectives
Strategic goals with measurable key results (metrics), tracked via progress percentages and health scores.

### Pulse Checks
Team sentiment and confidence ratings (1-5 scale) that provide qualitative feedback on objective health.

### Blockers
Obstacles preventing progress, categorized by severity (low, medium, high, critical) and status (open, in-progress, resolved).

### Health Score
Auto-calculated metric (0-100) combining pulse check data and blocker severity to indicate objective risk level.

### Metrics (Key Results)
Quantifiable measurements with current and target values that define objective success.

### Team Members
Users with team_member role who are assigned to objectives and submit pulse checks/blockers.

### Admins
Users with admin role who create objectives, manage team, and have full platform access.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **UI Library:** Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with credentials provider
- **State Management:** React hooks, server components

### Design Patterns
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** For SEO and initial page load performance
- **Client Components:** For interactive UI elements
- **RESTful API:** Consistent API route structure
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admin vs team member permissions
- **Anonymous Submissions:** For honest feedback without fear

## üé® Design System

### Colors
- **Primary:** Blue (#0066cc) - Actions, links, focus
- **Success:** Green (#10b981) - Healthy status
- **Warning:** Yellow (#f59e0b) - Warning status
- **Danger:** Red (#ef4444) - At-risk status
- **Neutral:** Gray scale - Backgrounds, text

### Health Score Indicators
- üü¢ **Green (80-100):** Healthy, on track
- üü° **Yellow (60-79):** Warning, needs attention
- üî¥ **Red (0-59):** At risk, immediate action needed

### Sentiment Scale
- üòû (1): Very negative
- üòï (2): Negative
- üòê (3): Neutral
- üôÇ (4): Positive
- üòä (5): Very positive
